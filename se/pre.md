## Introduction

<u>To address the issue of large-scale student assessment, we designed the AAT.</u>

Here is our poster. In Lean Canvas, each color corresponds to the part completed by each group member. In the risk register, each color corresponds to different categories of risk.

## Personal Demonstrate

### 1 Individual contributions 

In lean canvas, I finished the customer segment and early adopters parts. The colors are marked in orange.
<u>The customer is the university and the users are the teachers and students.</u>
<u>Early adopters are rapidly expanding universities, educators, and learning central of our academy</u>

In the risk register, I completed the legal risks, which are copyright and user privacy risks. The colors are marked in blue.

 I helped my team to create the format and layout of the PowerPoint poster.

### 2 reflect own experience when working as a team (shortcomings)

### 3 improvement for future business plan

For my personal tasks, I mainly studied the tutorials in the Learning Center. But I didn't try more tools that are already available in the market. For future work, I should try the existing products <u>and read the official manuals</u>.

In teamwork, Our group had problems in allocating tasks and not everyone got a fair task. For improvement, I plan to use excel and Git to track the team's progress <u>and assign team tasks fairly</u>.

这是我们的海报。在精益画布中，每种颜色对应每个小组成员完成的部分。在风险登记册中，每种颜色对应不同类别的风险。

在精益画布中，我完成了客户群和早期采用者部分。颜色标记为橙色。

在风险登记册中，我完成了法律风险，即版权和用户隐私风险。颜色标记为蓝色。

 我帮助团队创建了 PowerPoint 海报的格式和布局。

在个人任务方面，我主要学习了学习中心的教程。但我没有尝试更多市场上已有的工具。在今后的工作中，我应该尝试现有的产品。

在团队合作方面，我们小组在分配任务时遇到了问题，并不是每个人都能得到公平的任务。为了改进，我计划使用 excel 和 Git 来跟踪团队的进度

For the improvement of individual tasks, I should try more tools that are already available in the market.

For teamwork, there was an issue of assigning tasks unfairly. And I plan to use excel and Git to track the progress in the future.
